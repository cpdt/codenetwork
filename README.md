View online at [cpdt.github.io/codenetwork/public](https://cpdt.github.io/codenetwork/public/)

## Development

The site is built in HTML, LESS, and CommonJS (with Browserify). In order to edit the site, first install [NPM](http://npmjs.com/) and run the following command in the repository root:

```
npm install
```

Modify the source code in the `src/` subfolder of this repo, and then run:

```
grunt
```

in order to update the 'compiled' assets in the `public/` subfolder - this is what you should view in the browser when using the site.
